#### Game Rules

The Dice Game is played following these simple rules:

1.The game is played by two players taking alternate turns.<br><br>
2.Each turn, the player rolls a six-sided dice and adds the number rolled to their current score.<br><br>
3.After rolling the dice, the player has two options:<br><br>
  &nbsp;A.**Hold**: The player can choose to hold and add the current dice roll to their total score. It then becomes the opponent's turn.<br><br>
  &nbsp;B.**Roll Again**: The player can choose to roll the dice again. If a 1 is rolled, the player's turn ends, and they lose all the points accumulated in that turn. If any other number is rolled, it is added to their current score, and they can decide whether to hold or roll again.<br><br>
6.The game continues until one player reaches a score of 100 or more.<br><br>
5.The first player to reach or exceed a score of 100 wins the game.<br><br>
